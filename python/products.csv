Zinc plays a major influence in chlorophyll formation, photosynthesis, metabolic and energy process.  Zinc deficiencies are prevalent in almost all crops and soils in the country.  The result of zinc deficiencies is stunted crop growth, prolonged duration, and poor yields.  ABOUT Z3 – ZINC MICRONUTRIENT FERTILIZER Zinc Deficiencies can be easily rectified by using Z3.  Z3 being in the chelated form, it ensures complete availability of the Zinc to the plant without fixation in the soil.  Z3 improves the efficiency of NPK applied and is easily absorbed by the plants in all weather conditions & soils and is completely soluble in water.  Directions for use: Dissolve 100 grams of Z3 in 150-200 liters of water snd spray over one acre of standing crop on both sides of leaves. The dose may be increased or application repeated depending upon the severity of Zinc deficiency and the nature of the crop.

These bacteria form root nodules in pulses, groundnut, soybean, and green manure crops and fix the nitrogen from the atmosphere benefitting the crop and soil. Nodules act like a mini fertilizer factory and continue to supply nitrogen until their decay. The leaf fall, root exudates, and the decay of nodules contribute to enriching soil nitrogen. This renders the use of less nitrogenous fertilizer to the succeeding crop after pulses or green manure cultivation. Native soil rhizobia are not as effective as selected elite rhizobia recommended for seed inoculation or soil application.\n * ROM-Rhizobium has a bacterial count of not less than 2×109 /g/ml and can be used in red gram, green gram, black gram, cowpea, Bengal gram, horse gram, groundnut, soybean, and green manure crops. This biofertilizer is available in liquid or powder formulation and can be easily applied on seed and soil.\n * Dosage: For seed treatment, 1 kg of Rhizobium is recommended for the seeds required for 1 acre.
